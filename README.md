# Video-Understanding-with-PyTorch-
Created real-time Video Understanding pipeline with **Video Classification**, **Video Action Detection**, and **Video Self-Supervised Learning** with 650,000 video clips covering 700 types of human action.

Based on PyTorch: Built using PyTorch. Makes it easy to use all of the PyTorch-ecosystem components.
Reproducible Model Zoo: Variety of state of the art pretrained video models and their associated benchmarks that are ready to use. Complementing the model zoo, PyTorchVideo comes with extensive data loaders supporting different datasets.
Efficient Video Components: Video-focused fast and efficient components that are easy to use. Supports accelerated inference on hardware.
